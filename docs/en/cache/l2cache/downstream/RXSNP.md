# RXSNP

## Functional Description
The RXSNP module processes Snoop requests from the RXSNP bus channel, converts
them into internal task formats, and sends them to RequestArb. Meanwhile, if
there is an ongoing MSHR that meets the following conditions, the RXSNP bus is
blocked from entering SinkB:
- The address is the same and cannot be nested by this Snoop request.
- The data block to be replaced has the same address as this Snoop request and
  cannot be nested by this Snoop.

### Feature 1: When does Snoop(addr=X) nest within an ongoing read operation (addr=X) being processed by MSHR?
1. Before MSHR receives the first response data, a Snoop with the same address
   has higher priority and should be processed first.
2. After MSHR receives the first response data, a Snoop with the same address
   should wait for this MSHR to complete before being responded to.
3. Before MSHR sends WriteBackFull/Evict to write the backfill data into DS,
   Snoop should be blocked because the data required by Snoop is still in the
   refillBuffer, not in DS.
4. When MSHR sends WriteBackFull/Evict and the backfill data has been written to
   DS, Snoop should be prioritized for response because Snoop has higher
   priority.

### Feature 2: When does Snoop(addr=Y) nest within an ongoing MSHR replacement (the replaced line address addr=Y)?
1. When MSHR determines that a certain way is being replaced and the probe to
   the Core generated by this replacement has not completed, this Snoop is
   blocked because it may generate an identical probe to the Core for the same
   address.
2. If all probes to the Core from MSHR have completed, Snoop should nest within
   MSHR.
3. When MSHR is a CMO operation, Snoop is blocked until all generated Probe
   operations are completed.
