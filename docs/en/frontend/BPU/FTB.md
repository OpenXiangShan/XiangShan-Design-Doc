# BPU submodule FTB

## Functional Overview

The FTB temporarily stores FTB entries, providing more accurate branch
instruction locations, types, and other information for subsequent advanced
predictors. Within the FTB module, an FTBBank module is responsible for the
actual storage of FTB entries, utilizing a multi-port SRAM as memory.

### Request reception

At stage 0, the FTB module sends a read request to the internal FTBBank, with
the request PC value being the PC passed in from s0.

Data read and return

In the next clock cycle after sending the request, which is stage 1 of the
predictor, the multi-path signals read from the FTB SRAM will be temporarily
stored.

In the next cycle, which is stage 2 of the predictor, the hit signal is
generated from the temporary data based on the matching of each way's tag with
the actual request tag, and the hit FTB data is selected if a hit occurs. If
there is a hit request, the return value is the selected FTB entry and the hit
way information; if no hit occurs, the output data is meaningless. The tag
corresponds to bits 29 to 10 of the PC.

The data read from the FTBBank module is passed as a 2-stage prediction result
to subsequent predictors via combinational logic within the same cycle.
Additionally, this read result is temporarily stored within the FTB module and
passed again as a prediction result to subsequent predictors via combinational
logic in the 3rd stage. If the FTB hits, the read hit way number is also passed
as meta information to the subsequent FTQ module in stage s3, along with the hit
information and cycle count.

Additionally, if there is an "always taken" flag in the FTB entry, the
corresponding br_taken_mask in the prediction results of stage 2 is also pulled
high within this module.

### Data update

Upon receiving an update request, the FTB module determines the update timing
based on whether the meta information indicates a hit. If the meta shows a hit,
the update is performed immediately in the current cycle. Otherwise, it must
wait for 2 cycles to read the existing results from the FTB before proceeding
with the update.

Within the FTBBank, when an update request exists, the module's behavior also
differs between immediate and deferred updates. For immediate updates, the SRAM
write channel in FTBBank is activated, completing the write with the given
information. For deferred updates, FTBBank first receives a read request for the
update with higher priority than normal prediction read requests, then reads the
data in the next cycle, selecting the way encoding that hits the given address
and passing it to the external FTB module. If there is no hit in this cycle, the
next cycle requires writing to the allocated way. The way selection rule is: if
all ways are full, use a replacement algorithm (here, pseudo-LRU, see ICache
documentation for details) to select the way to replace; otherwise, select an
empty way.

## Interface timing

### Result output interface

![Result Output Interface](../figure/BPU/FTB/port1.png)

The above diagram shows the interface where the FTB module in the branch
predictor outputs prediction results across three consecutive cycles for a
request with a fallThrough address of 0x2000001062, at different stages of the
branch predictor.

### Update interface

![Update interface](../figure/BPU/FTB/port2.png)

The figure above demonstrates an update operation of the FTB module for address
0x2000000E00, where all update data is transmitted within a single clock cycle.

## FTBBank

### Interface timing

#### Read data interface

![Read data interface](../figure/BPU/FTB/port3.png)

The above figure shows the FTBBank read data interface. FTBBank replies with
data one cycle after receiving the request, i.e., the response at 16303ps
corresponds to the 0x2000001060 address request at 16301ps.

#### Update read data interface

![Update Read Data Interface](../figure/BPU/FTB/port4.png) The above diagram
shows the FTBBank's update read data interface. The FTBBank replies with data
one cycle after receiving the update read request, and the returned data is used
by the external module to update the write data one cycle later. Note that the
pftAddr one cycle after the request is used for writing the data one cycle after
the result is read out.

#### Update write data interface

![Update write data interface](../figure/BPU/FTB/port5.png) The above figure
shows the FTBBank update write data interface. One cycle after receiving the
write request, the data is written.

### Functional Overview

As mentioned above, the FTBBank primarily stores FTB entries and is a simple
encapsulation of the SRAM module.

## Brief description of FTB entry generation conditions

FTB is the core of BPU. All predictions made by other prediction components of
BPU rely on the information provided by FTB. In addition to providing
information about branch instructions within the prediction block, FTB also
provides the end address of the prediction block. For FTB, the generation
strategy of FTB entries is crucial. Based on the original paper 1, the Nanhu
architecture combines the ideas from paper 2 to form the current strategy. Let
the start address of the FTB entry be 'start' and the end address be 'end'. The
specific strategy is as follows:

- The FTB entry is indexed by start, where start is generated in the prediction
  pipeline. In practice, start generally follows one of the following
  principles:
  - start is the end of the previous prediction block.
  - start is the target address of the redirect from outside the BPU;
- The FTB entry can record up to two branch instructions, with the first one
  always being a conditional branch;
- The end must satisfy one of the three conditions:
  - end - start = prediction width
  - end is the PC of the third branch instruction within the predicted width
    range starting from start
  - end is the PC of the next instruction following an unconditional jump
    branch, and it falls within the prediction width range starting from start

Under this training strategy, the same branch instruction may exist in multiple
FTB entries.

Similar to the implementation in the paper
[1](https://docs.xiangshan.cc/zh-cn/latest/frontend/bp/#fn:ftbcite), we only
store the lower bits of the end address, while the higher bits are concatenated
from the higher bits of the start address. Like AMD's approach
[3](https://docs.xiangshan.cc/zh-cn/latest/frontend/bp/#fn:amd), we also record
an "always taken" bit for conditional branch instructions in the
[FTB](https://docs.xiangshan.cc/zh-cn/latest/frontend/bp/#ftb) entry. This bit
is set to 1 when the conditional branch is first encountered and taken. When
this bit is 1, the direction of the conditional branch is always predicted as
taken, and its results are not used to train the conditional branch direction
predictor. When the conditional branch encounters an execution result of not
taken, this bit is set to 0, and thereafter its direction is predicted by the
conditional branch direction predictor.

## FTB storage structure

FTB entry structure is as follows

| total | valid     | brSlot                   | tailSlot                  | pftAddr                   | carry                                                     | isCall, isRet, isJalr | last_may_be_rvi_call | strong_bias |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
|       | Valid bit | First branch information | Second branch information | Predict block end address | Whether the high-order bits of the end address carry over | tailSlot branch type  | RAS special flag bit | Strong bias |
| 62    | 1         | 21                       | 29                        | 4                         | 1                                                         | 3                     | 1                    | 2           |

Composition of FTB slots, each slot corresponds to one branch instruction

| total | valid     | offset                             | lower                        | tarStat                                          | sharing                                                  | isRVC                           |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
|       | Valid bit | Offset relative to the starting PC | Lower bits of target address | Whether the target address high bit carries over | (For tailSlot) Whether a conditional branch is installed | Is it a compressed instruction? |
| 21/29 | 1         | 4                                  | 12/20                        | 2                                                | 1                                                        | 1                               |

The FTB has a total of 2048 entries, 4-way set-associative, with each entry
recording up to 2 branches. The first branch is always a conditional branch,
while the second may be any type of branch instruction.

## Target address generation logic

For each slot, based on three possible high-bit carry scenarios
(carry/borrow/unchanged), select one from (PC high bits +1, PC high bits -1, PC
high bits) and concatenate it with the stored target address low bits.

## Update process

1. Entry generation

   1.1 Read necessary information from FTQ:
      - Starting address startAddr
      - The old FTB entry old_entry read during prediction
      - Contains the pre-decoding information pd for all branch instructions
        within the 32Byte FTQ entry
      - The actual jump results cfiIndex of valid instructions within this FTQ
        entry, including whether it jumps and the offset of the jump instruction
        relative to startAddr
      - The jump address (execution result) of the branch instruction (e.g.,
        jump) within this FTQ entry
      - Whether the FTB actually hits during prediction (whether the old FTB
        entry is valid)
      - The misprediction mask for all possible instructions corresponding to
        the FTQ entry

   1.2 FTB entry generation logic:
      - Case 1: FTB miss or error exists
        1) Unconditional jump instruction processing:
          - Regardless of whether it is executed, it will always be written to
            the tailSlot of the new FTB entry
          - If the jump instruction in the final FTQ entry is a conditional
            branch, write it to the first brSlot of the new FTB entry and set
            the corresponding always_taken bit to 1
        2) pftAddr settings:
          - When an unconditional jump instruction is present: set the end
            address of the first unconditional jump instruction
          - When there is no unconditional jump instruction: set to startAddr +
            fetch width (32B)
          - Special case: When the start address of a 4-byte-wide unconditional
            jump instruction is at startAddr+30, even if the end address exceeds
            the fetch width range, it is still set as startAddr+32
        3) The carry bit is set simultaneously based on the condition of pftAddr
        4) Set branch type flags:
          - isJalr, isCall, isRet are set according to the type of the first
            unconditional jump instruction
          - Special flag: The last_may_be_rvi_call bit is set if and only if the
            first unconditional jump instruction of 4-byte width starts at
            startAddr+30, and the instruction is of call type.

      - Case 2: FTB hit with no errors
        1) Insert new conditional branch:
          - When there is an available slot: a) tailSlot has an unconditional
            jump: the new conditional branch must be instructionally prior to
            this unconditional jump and is directly inserted into brSlot. b)
            brSlot has a conditional branch: arrange in instruction order,
            ensuring branches in brSlot within the FTB entry are instructionally
            prior to those in tailSlot. c) In the above cases, pftAddr does not
            need modification.
          - When there is no free slot: a) tailSlot has an unconditional jump:
              - The new conditional branch instruction sequence must precede the
                unconditional jump
              - New conditional branch replaces the position of an unconditional
                jump.
              - pftAddr is set according to the PC of the unconditional jump b)
                tailSlot conditional branch: i) The new conditional branch
                instruction sequence is earlier than the existing conditional
                branch instruction sequence in the tailSlot:
                - Arrange the conditional branches in brSlot and new conditional
                  branches in instruction order
                - pftAddr is set according to the PC of the original branch in
                  tailSlot. ii) The new conditional branch instruction sequence
                  is located after all existing branch instructions:
                - No changes occur in the slot
                - Only set pftAddr according to the PC of the new conditional
                  branch
        2) Update jalr jump address information:
          - When the tailSlot originally records a jalr (RISC-V's unconditional
            indirect jump instruction)
          - When the jump address changes, modify the corresponding target
            address low bits and high carry information recorded in the
            tailSlot.
        3) Update the always_taken bit:
          - If the always_taken bit is set to 1 and the corresponding
            conditional branch execution result is not taken, pull the
            always_taken bit low

2. Write to SRAM

   2.1 Write conditions:

    - The new FTB entry is completely unchanged, or although the FTB misses but
      the uFTB hits: no need to write.
    - New FTB entry has changes and is not a uFTB hit or FTB miss: requires
      writing.

   2.2 Write Process:
      - Case 1: Prediction miss
        1) First, perform an FTB read in one cycle to determine the hit
           condition at this time
        2) If hit, write to the corresponding way
        3) If it still misses, select a way to write according to the
           replacement algorithm
        4) The entire process requires 3 clock cycles
        5) During the process, due to FTB read/write port occupancy, the FTQ
           must coordinate to avoid issuing new update requests.
           - Note: Bank partitioning may improve update bandwidth.
      - Case 2: Prediction hit (including cases where the hit entry contains
        erroneous information)
        1) Directly write to the corresponding way without needing to read again
