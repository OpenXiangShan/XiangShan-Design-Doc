## Functional Description

The FTQ sends predicted block requests to both the ICache and IFU modules. The
IFU waits for up to two cache lines of instruction codes returned from the
ICache, then splits them to generate initial instruction codes within the fetch
request range. These are sent to the pre-decoder for pre-decoding. In the next
cycle, the valid instruction range is adjusted based on pre-decoding
information, and the instruction codes are expanded along with other information
before being sent to the IBuffer module. When the ICache detects that the
address belongs to MMIO space, the IFU sends the address to the MMIO processing
unit for instruction fetch. At this point, the processor enters a multi-cycle
sequential execution mode, and the IFU stalls the pipeline until it receives a
commit signal from the ROB, allowing the next instruction fetch request to
proceed. Additionally, the IFU handles special cases for 32-bit instructions
spanning MMIO address pages (retransmission mechanism).

### Accept FTQ instruction fetch requests

The IFU receives fetch requests from the FTQ in prediction block units,
including the prediction block start address, the next cacheline start address
of the current cacheline, the start address of the next prediction block, the
queue pointer of the prediction block in the FTQ, whether the prediction block
contains a taken CFI instruction and its position within the block, as well as
control signals (whether the request is valid and if the IFU is ready). Each
prediction block can contain up to 32 bytes of instruction code, with a maximum
of 16 instructions.

### Dual cacheline instruction fetch

If and only if the fetch address of a prediction block falls in the latter half
of a cacheline, to meet the requirement of a maximum 34-byte prediction block,
the IFU will fetch two consecutive cachelines from the ICache, generating
exception information (page fault and access fault) for each, and split them as
described in Feature 3.

After June 2024, the ICache implemented a low-power design, handling data
selection and concatenation internally. Thus, the IFU no longer needs to manage
how two cacheline data are concatenated and selected. It simply copies and
concatenates the data returned by the ICache for segmentation. Please refer to
[ICache
documentation](../ICache/index.md#sec:icache-dataarray-per-bank-lowpower).

You may also refer to [the comments in
IFU.scala](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/blob/fad7803d97ed4a987a743036cec42d1c07b48e2e/src/main/scala/xiangshan/frontend/IFU.scala#L474-L502).

### Instruction Splitting to Generate Initial Instruction Codes

In the next pipeline stage (F1), the PC for every 2 bytes within the predicted
block and other relevant information are calculated. The process then proceeds
to the F2 stage to await the instruction code from the ICache. At F2, it is
necessary to verify whether the instruction code returned by the ICache matches
the current pipeline stage (since the IFU pipeline may be flushed while the
ICache remains unaffected). Exception information (page fault and access fault)
for each instruction is generated based on the cache line exception information
returned by the ICache. Concurrently, the jump_range (the instruction range from
the start address to the first branch address in the predicted block) and
ftr_range (the instruction range from the start address to the next predicted
block's start address in the absence of a branch) are calculated using the taken
information from the FTQ. For timing considerations, the two ports of the ICache
return cache lines for both miss and hit scenarios, resulting in four cache
lines that need to generate four combinations (two from port 0 and two from port
1) for parallel pre-decoding. F2 simultaneously selects 17Ã—2-byte initial
instruction codes from the 64-byte returned data (of which 40 bytes are valid)
based on the predicted block's start address and sends them to four PreDecode
modules for pre-decoding.

### Generate predecode information

The PreDecode module receives the 17 initial 2-byte instruction codes segmented
by F2. On one hand, it pre-decodes these initial instruction codes according to
the decoding table to obtain pre-decoding information, including whether the
instruction is the start of a valid instruction, whether it is an RVC
instruction, whether it is a CFI instruction, the CFI instruction type
(branch/JAL/JALR/call/ret), and the target address calculation offset for CFI
instructions. The encoding of the brType field in the output pre-decoding
information is as follows:

Table 1.2 CFI Instruction Type Encoding

| CFI Instruction Type | Type Encoding (brType) |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Non-CFI instruction  | 00                     |
| branch instruction   | 01                     |
| jal instruction      | 10                     |
| jalr instruction     | 11                     |

### Generate instruction code and instruction code extension

While generating pre-decoding information, the initial instructions are grouped
into 4-byte units (starting from the initial address, with 2-byte address
increments, and the first 4 bytes at the address forming a 32-bit initial
instruction code) to produce the instruction code for each instruction.

In the next cycle (F3) after generating the instruction code and pre-decode
information, the instruction codes of the 16 instructions are sent to 16
instruction expanders for 32-bit instruction expansion (RVC instructions are
expanded according to the manual specifications, while RVI instructions retain
their original codes).

### Branch Prediction Overriding Flushes the Pipeline

When the FTQ does not cache enough prediction blocks, the IFU may directly use
the predicted address provided by a simple branch predictor for instruction
fetching. In this case, if the precise predictor detects an error in the simple
predictor, it must notify the IFU to cancel the ongoing fetch request.
Specifically: \
- If the BPU's S2 pipeline stage detects an error, the IFU's F0 stage must be
flushed. \
- If the BPU's S3 pipeline stage detects an error, the IFU's F0/F1 stages must
be flushed (the BPU's simple predictor provides results in S1 and performs
overriding by S3 at the latest, so the IFU's F2/F3 stages are guaranteed to have
the best prediction and do not require flushing; similarly, there is no BPU S2
to IFU F1 flushing).

When the IFU receives a flush request from the BPU, it compares the pointer of
the fetch request in the F0F1 pipeline stage with the pointer from the BPU's
flush request. If the flush pointer precedes the fetch pointer, it indicates
that the current fetch request is on an incorrect execution path, necessitating
a pipeline flush. Otherwise, the IFU can ignore this flush request from the BPU.

### Early branch prediction error check

To reduce flushes caused by easily identifiable branch prediction errors, the
IFU performs frontend branch prediction error checks at the F3 pipeline stage
using pre-decode information generated by F2. The pre-decode information is
first sent to the PredChecker module, which checks for jal-type errors, ret-type
errors, invalid instruction prediction errors, and non-CFI instruction
prediction errors based on the CFI instruction type. It also calculates 16
branch target addresses from the instruction code and compares them with the
predicted target addresses to check for target address errors. The PredChecker
corrects jal-type and ret-type prediction errors and regenerates the instruction
valid range vector fixedRange (where 1 indicates the instruction is within the
prediction block). fixedRange narrows down the range from jump_range and
ftr_range based on jal and ret check results, limiting it to the start address
up to any undetected jal or ret instructions. Below are the types of branch
prediction errors checked by the PredChecker module:

- JAL type error: The predicted block contains a JAL instruction, but the
  predictor did not predict a branch for this instruction.
- ret type error: There is a ret instruction within the prediction block's
  range, but the predictor did not predict a jump for this instruction.
- Invalid instruction misprediction: The predictor made a prediction for an
  invalid instruction (outside the predicted block range or in the middle of a
  32-bit instruction).
- Non-CFI instruction misprediction: The predictor mispredicts a valid but
  non-CFI instruction.
- Branch Target Address Error: The predictor provided an incorrect branch target
  address.

### Frontend Redirect

If the F3 branch prediction check reveals any of the five prediction errors
described in Feature 7, the IFU will generate a frontend redirect in the next
cycle, flushing all pipeline stages except F3. The FTQ and predictor flushes
will be handled by the FTQ after the IFU writes back to the FTQ.

### Send Instruction Codes and Frontend Instruction Information to IBuffer

The F3 pipeline stage ultimately obtains the expanded 32-bit instruction code,
along with exception information, pre-decoding information, FTQ pointers, and
other backend-required data (such as folded PC) for each of the 16 instructions.
In addition to the conventional valid-ready control signals, the IFU provides
two special signals to the IBuffer: one is the 16-bit io_toIbuffer_bits_valid,
indicating valid instructions within the predicted block (1 marks the start of
an instruction, while 0 indicates the middle of an instruction). The other is
the 16-bit io_toIbuffer_bits_enqEnable, which is derived by ANDing
io_toIbuffer_bits_valid with the corrected instruction range fixedRange of the
predicted block. An enqEnable value of 1 signifies that this 2-byte instruction
code is both the start of an instruction and within the instruction range
represented by the predicted block.

### Instruction information and misprediction information writeback to FTQ

In the WB stage following F3, the IFU writes back to the FTQ the instruction PC,
pre-decoding information, mispredicted instruction positions, correct jump
addresses, and the correct instruction range of the prediction block, while
passing the FTQ pointer of the prediction block to distinguish between different
requests.

### Cross-prediction block 32-bit instruction handling

Due to the limited length of predicted blocks, there may be cases where the two
bytes of an RVI instruction span across two predicted blocks. The IFU first
checks whether the last 2 bytes of the initial predicted block mark the start of
an RVI instruction. If so and there is no branch in this predicted block, a flag
register f3_lastHalf_valid is set to inform the subsequent predicted block that
it contains the latter half of the instruction. During F2 pre-decoding, two
distinct instruction valid vectors are generated:

- The start of a prediction block is also the start of an instruction. Based on
  whether subsequent instructions are RVC or RVI, the instruction valid vector
  is generated in this manner.
- The prediction block's start address is in the middle of an RVI instruction,
  generating a valid vector with the instruction starting at start address + 2.

In F3, the final instruction valid vector is determined based on whether there
is a cross-prediction block RVI flag. If f3_lastHalf_valid is high, the latter
is selected (i.e., the first 2 bytes of this prediction block are not the start
of an instruction). As described in Feature 2 earlier, if and only if the start
address is in the latter half of the cacheline, two cachelines will be fetched
from the ICache. Therefore, even if this cross-prediction block RVI instruction
spans cachelines, each prediction block can obtain its complete instruction
code. The IFU's processing simply counts this instruction in the first
prediction block while invalidating the 2-byte at the start address position of
the second prediction block by modifying the instruction valid vector.

### MMIO instruction fetch

During processor power-on reset, since memory initialization is not yet
complete, the processor needs to fetch instructions from flash storage for
execution. In this case, the IFU must send 64-bit requests to the MMIO bus to
fetch instructions from the flash address space. Additionally, the IFU prohibits
speculative execution on the MMIO bus, meaning the IFU must wait for each
instruction to complete execution and obtain the accurate next instruction
address before sending the next request to the bus.

After the processor powers on or resets, it fetches instructions starting from
address 0x10000000. The ICache translates the address through ITLB to obtain the
physical address, which is then checked by PMP to determine if it belongs to
MMIO space. The result is returned to the IFU F2 pipeline stage (refer to the
ICache documentation). If the instruction fetch request is for MMIO address
space, the IFU blocks the request at F3 and a state machine controls the MMIO
instruction fetch, as shown in the following diagram:

![F3 MMIO State Machine Diagram](../figure/IFU//IFU/f3_mmio_fsm.svg)

1. The state machine defaults to the `m_idle` state. If the F3 pipeline stage is
   an MMIO instruction fetch request and no exceptions have occurred previously,
   the state machine transitions to the `m_waitLastCmt` state.
2. (`m_waitLastCmt`) The IFU queries the FTQ via the mmioCommitRead port to
   check if all instructions prior to the IF3 prediction block have been
   committed. If not, it stalls until all preceding instructions are
   committed[^ifu_spec_mmio_fetch].
3. (`m_sendReq`) sends the request to the InstrUncache module, issuing a request
   to the MMIO bus.
4. (`m_waitResp`) After the InstrUncache module returns, the instruction code is
   extracted from the 64-bit data based on the PC.
5. If the lower bits of the pc are `3'b110`, due to the MMIO bus bandwidth
   limitation of 8B and alignment requirements, the upper 2B of this request
   will not contain valid data. If the returned instruction data indicates the
   instruction is not RVC, this situation requires a resend at pc+2 (aligned to
   the next 8B boundary) to fetch the complete 4B instruction code.
   1. Before resending, ITLB address translation and PMP checks must be
      reperformed for pc+2 (as it may cross a page boundary) (`m_sendTLB`,
      `m_TLBResp`, `m_sendPMP`). If ITLB or PMP raises an exception (access
      fault, page fault, guest page fault) or checks reveal pc+2 is not in MMIO
      address space, the exception information is sent directly to the backend
      without fetching.
   2. If no exceptions occur, (`m_resendReq`, `m_waitResendResp`) follows steps
      2/3 to issue a request to InstrUncache and receive the instruction code.
6. When the IFU registers the complete instruction code or encounters an error
   (ITLB/PMP error during retry, or corrupt returned by the Uncache module's
   tilelink bus), (`m_waitCommit`) it can send the instruction data and
   exception information to the IBuffer. Note that MMIO instruction fetches can
   only non-speculatively request one instruction at a time from the bus, so
   only one instruction's data can be sent to the IBuffer. It must then wait for
   the instruction to commit.
   1. If this instruction is a CFI instruction, it is sent by the backend to
      initiate a flush to the FTQ.
   2. For sequential instructions, the IFU reuses the frontend redirection path
      to flush the pipeline and leverages the FTQ writeback mechanism, treating
      it as a mispredicted instruction for flushing, redirecting to the
      instruction address +2 or +4 (depending on whether the instruction is RVI
      or RVC). This mechanism ensures that only one instruction is fetched from
      MMIO at a time.
7. After commit (`m_commited`), the state machine resets to `m_idle` and clears
   all registers.

Apart from power-on, the debug extension and Svpbmt extension may also cause the
processor to jump to an MMIO address space for instruction fetch at any time
during operation. Refer to the RISC-V manual. The handling of MMIO instruction
fetch in these cases is identical.

[^ifu_spec_mmio_fetch]: It is worth noting that the Svpbmt extension introduces
an `NC` attribute, representing a non-cacheable but idempotent memory region.
This means we can speculatively execute in `NC` regions, i.e., we can send
instruction fetch requests to the bus without "waiting for prior instructions to
commit," manifesting as the state machine skipping the wait state.
Implementation details can be found in
[#3944](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3944).

### Trigger implements hardware breakpoint functionality for the PC.

There are a total of 4 Triggers in the IFU's FrontendTrigger module, numbered
0-3. The configuration information (breakpoint type, matching address, etc.) for
each Trigger is stored in the `tdata` registers.

When software writes specific values to the CSR registers `tselect` and
`tdata1/2`, the CSR sends a tUpdate request to the IFU to update the
configuration information in the `tdata` registers of FrontendTrigger.
Currently, frontend Triggers can only be configured as PC breakpoints
(`mcontrol.select` register is 0; when `mcontrol.select`=1, the Trigger will
never hit and will not generate an exception).

During instruction fetch, the IFU's F3 pipeline stage queries the
FrontendTrigger module and receives results in the same cycle. The latter checks
each instruction in the fetch block against every Trigger. When not in debug
mode, if the instruction's PC and the content of the `tdata2` register satisfy
the relationship indicated by the `mcontrol.match` bits (Xiangshan supports
`mcontrol.match` bits 0, 2, and 3, corresponding to equal, greater than, and
less than), the instruction is marked as a Trigger hit. This triggers a
breakpoint exception in the backend during execution, entering M-Mode or debug
mode. The frontend Trigger supports the Chain function. When their corresponding
`mcontrol.chain` bit is set, an exception is only generated if both the current
Trigger and the next numbered Trigger hit simultaneously[^trigger_timing].

[^trigger_timing]: In previous versions (riscv-debug-spec-draft, corresponding
to XiangShan's [PR#3693](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan/pull/3693)
merged on 2024.10.05), Chain also required the two Triggers' `mcontrol.timing`
to be identical. In the new version (riscv-debug-spec-v1.0.0), `mcontrol.timing`
has been removed. Currently, XiangShan's Scala implementation retains this bit,
but its value is always 0 and cannot be written, and the generated Verilog code
does not include it. Reference:
[https://github.com/riscv/riscv-debug-spec/pull/807](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-debug-spec/pull/807).

## Overall design

### Overall block diagram and pipeline stages

![Overall Block Diagram of IFU Module](../figure/IFU/IFU/structure.png)

![IFU Module Pipeline Stages](../figure/IFU/IFU/stages.svg)

### Interface timing

#### FTQ Request Interface Timing Example

![FTQ Request Interface Timing Example](../figure/IFU/IFU/port1.png)

The diagram above illustrates three FTQ request examples: req1 only requests
cacheline line0, followed by req2 requesting line1 and line2. When req3 arrives,
due to the instruction cache SRAM's write priority, the instruction cache read
request ready signal is driven low, and req3's valid and address signals are
held until the request is accepted.

#### ICache Return Interface and Timing Example to IBuffer and FTQ Writeback Interface

![ICache Return Interface and Timing Example to IBuffer and FTQ Writeback
Interface](../figure/IFU/IFU/port2.png)

The above diagram shows the timing from when the instruction cache returns data
to the IFU detecting a misprediction until the FTQ sends the correct address.
The request corresponding to group0 fetches two cache lines, line0 and line1, in
the f2 stage. In the next cycle, the IFU performs misprediction checks while
simultaneously sending instructions to the Ibuffer. However, backend pipeline
stalls cause the Ibuffer to fill up, lowering the ready signal at the Ibuffer's
receiving end, keeping group0-related signals until the request is accepted by
the Ibuffer. However, the writeback from IFU to FTQ is asserted in the cycle
following tio_toIbuffer_valid, as the request has already entered the wb stage
without blocking. This stage latches the PredChecker's results, reporting that
the instruction at the 4th 2-byte position (0-indexed) in group0 was
mispredicted and should redirect to vaddrA. After 4 cycles (flushing and
re-running the predictor pipeline), the FTQ resends a prediction block starting
at vaddrA to the IFU.

#### MMIO request interface timing example

![MMIO Request Interface Timing Example](../figure/IFU/IFU/port3.png)

The above diagram illustrates the instruction fetch timing for an MMIO request,
req1. Initially, the tlbExcp information returned by the ICache indicates that
this is an instruction in MMIO space (other exception signals must remain low).
After two cycles, the IFU sends a request to the InstrUncache. After some time,
it receives the response along with the 32-bit instruction code. In the same
cycle, the IFU sends this instruction as a predicted block to the IBuffer and
writes back to the FTQ, reusing the misprediction signal port with the redirect
address set to the next instruction's address. At this point, the IFU enters a
wait state for instruction completion. Later, the rob_commits port reports the
completion of this instruction's execution with no backend redirection. The IFU
then reinitiates the instruction fetch request for the next MMIO instruction.
